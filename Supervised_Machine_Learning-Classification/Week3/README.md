# Decision Trees

Decision tree methods are a common baseline model for classification tasks due to their visual appeal and high interpretability. This module walks you through the theory behind decision trees and a few hands-on examples of building decision tree models for classification. You will realize the main pros and cons of these techniques. This background will be useful when you are presented with decision tree ensembles in the next module.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe and use decision trees and decision-tree ensemble models for classification
- Identify and implement common ensemble models for classification, including bagging, boosting, stacking, and random forest.
- Become familiarized with the pros and cons of decision tree methods
- Build decision trees models with sklearn

# Ensemble Models

Ensemble models are a very popular technique as they can assist your models be more resistant to outliers and have better chances at generalizing with future data. They also gained popularity after several ensembles helped people win prediction competitions. Recently, stochastic gradient boosting became a go-to candidate model for many data scientists. This model walks you through the theory behind ensemble models and popular tree-based ensembles.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify, use, and interpret common ensemble models for classification, including bagging, boosting, stacking, and random forest.
- Build ensemble models with sklearn, including bagging, boosting, stacking, and random forest.
- Identify common supervised machine learning algorithms.
