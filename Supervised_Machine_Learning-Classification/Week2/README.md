# K Nearest Neighbors

K Nearest Neighbors is a popular classification method because they are easy computation and easy to interpret. This module walks you through the theory behind k nearest neighbors as well as a demo for you to practice building k nearest neighbors models with sklearn.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify common supervised machine learning algorithms.
- Identify, use, and interpret k nearest neighbors models for classification
- Build k nearest neighbors models with sklearn

# Support Vector Machines

This module will walk you through the main idea of how support vector machines construct hyperplanes to map your data into regions that concentrate a majority of data points of a certain class. Although support vector machines are widely used for regression, outlier detection, and classification, this module will focus on the latter.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify common supervised machine learning algorithms.
- Describe and use support vector machines for classification
- Realize the importance of the kernel trick for non-linear classification
- Build support vector machines models with sklearn
