# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is one of the most studied and widely used classification algorithms, probably due to its popularity in regulated industries and financial settings. Although more modern classifiers might likely output models with higher accuracy, logistic regressions are great baseline models due to their high interpretability and parametric nature. This module will walk you through extending a linear regression example into a logistic regression, as well as the most common error metrics that you might want to use to compare several classifiers and select that best suits your business problem.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify, use, and interpret error metrics to evaluate classification models.
- Identify common supervised machine learning algorithms.
- Build logistic regression classification models with sklearn.
- Use logistic regression models for classification.
