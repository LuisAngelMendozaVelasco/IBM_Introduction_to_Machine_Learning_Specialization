# Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing

Inferential statistics and hypothesis testing are two types of data analysis often overlooked at early stages of analyzing your data. They can give you quick insights about the quality of your data. They also help you confirm business intuition and help you prescribe what to analyze next using Machine Learning. This module looks at useful definitions and simple examples that will help you get started creating hypothesis around your business problem and how to test them.
