# A Brief History of Modern AI and its Applications

Artificial Intelligence is not new, but it is new in a sense that it is easier than ever to get started using Machine Learning in business settings. In this module, we will go over a quick introduction to AI and Machine Learning and we will visit a brief history of the modern AI. We will also explore some of the current applications of AI and Machine Learning for you, to think about how you want to leverage them in your day to day business practice or personal projects.
