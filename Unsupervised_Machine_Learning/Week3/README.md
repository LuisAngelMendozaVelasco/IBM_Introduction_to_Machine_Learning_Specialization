# Dimensionality Reduction

This module introduces dimensionality reduction and Principal Component Analysis, which are powerful techniques for big data, imaging, and pre-processing data. At the end of this module, you will have all the tools in your toolkit to highlight your Unsupervised Learning abilities in your final project.

## Learning Objectives

- Become familiar with common dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis
- Explain non negative matrix factorization, and how it makes PCA difficult with many features
- Become familiar with the scikit learn syntax for PCA
