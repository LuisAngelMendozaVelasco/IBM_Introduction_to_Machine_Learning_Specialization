# Selecting a clustering algorithm

In this module you become familiar with some of the computational hurdles around clustering algorithms, and how different clustering implementations try to overcome them. After a brief recapitulation of common clustering algorithms, you will learn how to compare them and select the clustering technique that best suits your data.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the curse of dimensionality, and how it makes clustering difficult with many features
- Become familiar with common clustering techniques, including hierarchical agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN, and Mean Shift
- Use common techniques to compare clustering algorithms
- Become familiar with hierarchical agglomerative clustering syntax in scikit learn
