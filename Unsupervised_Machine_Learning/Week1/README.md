# Introduction to Unsupervised Learning and K Means

This module introduces Unsupervised Learning and its applications. One of the most common uses of Unsupervised Learning is clustering observations using k-means. In this module you become familiar with the theory behind this algorithm, and put it in practice in a demonstration.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the kinds of problems suitable for Unsupervised Learning approaches
- Describe the clustering process of the k-means algorithm
- Become familiar with k-means clustering syntax in scikit learn
