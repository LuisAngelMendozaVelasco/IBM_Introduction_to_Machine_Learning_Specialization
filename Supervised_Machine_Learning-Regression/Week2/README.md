# Data Splits and Polynomial Regression

There are a few best practices to avoid overfitting of your regression models. One of these best practices is splitting your data into training and test sets. Another alternative is to use cross validation. And a third alternative is to introduce polynomial features. This module walks you through the theoretical framework and a few hands-on examples of these best practices.

## Learning Objectives

- Realize the importance of having a test set to avoid overfitting
- Practice using the train_split function to split your data into training and testing sets
- Recognize the trade off between model complexity and prediction error
- Assess whether introducing polynomial features improves the error metrics of your linear regression
