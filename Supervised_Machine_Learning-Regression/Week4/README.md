# Bias Variance Trade off and Regularization Techniques: Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net

This module walks you through the theory and a few hands-on examples of regularization regressions including ridge, LASSO, and elastic net. You will realize the main pros and cons of these techniques, as well as their differences and similarities.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the bias-variance trade off and the sources of error.
- Recognize regularization as a tool to avoid overfitting of linear models.
- Recognize common approaches to regularization, including Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net regressions.
