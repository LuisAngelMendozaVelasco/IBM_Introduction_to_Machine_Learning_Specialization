# Cross Validation

There is a trade-off between the size of your training set and your testing set. If you use most of your data for training, you will have fewer samples to validate your model. Conversely, if you use more samples for testing, you will have fewer samples to train your model. Cross Validation will allow you to reuse your data to use more samples for training and testing.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify common cross validation approaches
- Recognize the trade off between model complexity, prediction error and precision error with less data
