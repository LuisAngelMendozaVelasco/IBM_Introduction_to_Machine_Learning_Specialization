# Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning and Linear Regression

This module introduces a brief overview of supervised machine learning and its main applications: classification and regression. After introducing the concept of regression, you will learn its best practices, as well as how to measure error and select the regression model that best suits your data.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the main types of Machine Learning
- Enumerate common day-to-day examples of Machine Learning applications
- Differentiate interpretation and prediction as the two main objectives of Machine Learning
- Identify statistical tests to assess the normality of outcome variables.
- Identify best practices for Linear Regression, including how to measure error.
- Become familiarized with the syntax to train a linear regression model and score a test set.
